# Cherry Music API

Cherry Music API is the backend service that powers the Cherry Music application.

It is responsible for managing music data, handling audio processing, and storing media assets. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, uses PostgreSQL for data persistence, and integrates external storage for audio and images.

This service is designed to support the frontend application in a scalable and maintainable way.
